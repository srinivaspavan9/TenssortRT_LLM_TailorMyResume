"         ENGINEERING BUSINESS UNIT LEADER       Summary    I am seeking a position within a Maintenance/Engineering department. I have completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering Technology with a concentration in Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science from Middle Tennessee State University. I feel that I am a great candidate to be employed in technical role due my education and experience with ArcelorMittal and PepsiCo. Course work for my degree included instrumentation controls and engineering economy, which is beneficial for technical manufacturing positions overseeing capital spend. Instrumentation controls class work show the design of electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic systems and other associated equipment that work in relation to one another. Engineering Economy provided me with the concepts of OEE, supply chain, and project cost effectiveness. I was able to use my education and gain experience with ArcelorMittal as an Operations Technician. As an Operations Technician, I was responsible for the OEE of automated weld cells. To ensure productivity, I reviewed faults in PLC programming, Fanuc Robot programming, or mechanically which required my problem solving abilities. I was required to understand CAD drawings and wiring schematics to troubleshoot and install components on the line, in which one has to have great analytical skills to accomplish. In my most recent experience with Frito Lay, I have gained experience through the Project Engineer & Maintenance/Engineering Business Unit Leader positions. The Project Engineer role required me to have excellent verbal and written communication skills. While holding this position I worked extensively with all departments within the facility on their requests to improve safety, quality & efficiencies. I was the technical point of contact between Frito Lay department leaders & vendors/ integrators. This role required my organization and planning skills to be at the highest level for projects to be implemented with minimum distribution to the supply chain. I currently hold the position of Maintenance/Engineering Business Unit Leader.  This role includes maintaining & improving line OEE and doing so within the limitation of a parts, labor and capital budget. My team and I review daily reports by production supervisors to solve issues ranging from an immediate daily fix or prepping the work for the next preventive maintenance schedule.  I am responsible for developing the skills of 34 mechanics, two admins and three shift supervisors by providing feedback on a one to one basis. Also, I am responsible for training mechanics to ensure work was being performed safely by OSHA standards and ensure a quality product was being produced to Frito and Federal/State Regulatory Laws. Frito Lay developed my leadership skills requiring me to engage and develop personnel to meet KPIs. My college career at MTSU, along with my vocation at ArcelorMittal and Frito Lay has provided me with great experience. My experience would make me a great candidate for this position at your facility. Thank you for taking the time to look at my resume and considering my request. Sincerely, Aaron Lovely Engineering Maintenance manager, who is a self-motivated, passionate individual with excellent decision-making skills, is seeking a technical position within an engineering team. Courses for an Engineering Technology degree require the ability to learn electrical and mechanical systems. Successfully put my education to use and expanded my learning in the electrical and mechanical field with my profession at ArcelorMittal and PepsiCo Frito Lay Division.

Experience      Engineering Business Unit Leader     Jan 2015   to   Current      Company Name   －   City  ,   State     Increased OEE performance from 13th rank to 4th in company by developing crewing models and using best practices with computer management maintenance system.

Executed $1.2Million of productivity projects through automation, efficiency improvements & headcount reductions.

"         INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COORDINATOR       Professional Profile    B.S. graduate with a record of success implementing IT solutions. Demonstrated commitment to quality and customer service, detail oriented, strong team player, self motivated, demonstrated exceptional analytical skills, proven ability to work effectively and cross functionally with all levels of management with responsibilities increasing in scope. 9+ years of experience as Client/Server developer using Transact SQL, PL\SQL, Classic ASP, ASP.net, HTML, DHTML, XML, JavaScript, using CSS layout and design principles. 7+ years of managing project timeliness, accuracy, approving high-level and detail designs, as well as managing successful test plans. Directed all stages of software development including requirements, design, coding, testing and implementation of several company wide Intranet initiatives like Ovations! - An associate rewards and recognition program used by over 30,000 employees; Kronos TM Workforce Central - a time and attendance program for 13,000 non-exempts employees. Several projects included the management of offsite vendor resources. Experience using the following database management tools MS SQL Server 6.5,7, 2000 and 2005, My SQL, and Oracle 9i. Proficient with MS Windows, MS Office, Minitab, Business Objects, Adobe CS3 Web Edition, Visual Studio, Frontpage, PaintShop Pro.           Experience      Information Technology Coordinator     Nov 2003   to   Current      Company Name       Provide technical support throughout the office from building and managing the web presence, networking computers and other office equipment as well as researching grant opportunities for the implementation of a technology component for the Leadership SOAR program. Responsible for building capacity for the foundation within the area of information technology by helping them move closer to a paperless environment. The scope of my role is to streamline IT operations, implement an effective online marketing and media strategy, automate the work processes for employees, and centralize the activities of GivingBack Foundation, Inc. by using the internet and other media.       Web Developer     Jun 2003   to   Current      Company Name       As webmaster I was responsible for the wing-to-wing implementation of online solutions for small businesses using the full System Development Life Cycle. All projects were delivered 100% on time, within budget by correctly assessing needs upfront, and gathering detailed design specifications that prevent scope creep. I was directly involved in the design/develop/testing phases, the implementing of database systems using Classic ASP/ASP.net 2.0 and MS SQL Server 2000/2005 in the Windows Hosting environment, PHP 4.0 - 5.0 and MySQL 4 in the Linux Hosting environment as well as providing support operations, and evaluating the overall system performance after project launch. A few key ASP.Net/MS SQL 2005 solutions implemented during this period were vendor developed ad tracking and e-mail newsletter marketing software. Clients relied upon the research and cost benefit analysis provided to determine the best solution that met their needs and budget.       Intranet Application Support Analyst     Jan 2003   to   Jul 2007      Company Name       Key responsibilities were to manage the timeliness and accuracy of system parameter setups and data migration of files for private label and bank card projects. Worked with functional areas such as Marketing, Risk, Fraud, Operations, and Collections to ensure that parameters implemented met project requirements by serving as the IT lead responsible for overcoming any organizational and technical barriers that arose. During this period I was able to successfully multi-task and manage several projects concurrently making my role key in the successful implementation of 14 new portfolios that had a combined growth of $1.26B in new receivables. Implemented successful business-wide initiatives such as: Ovations! - An associates rewards and recognition system. Primary responsibility was to enhance the system's Graphical User Interface and make it more intuitive for the users. The completed project resulted in a 50% increase in system productivity while remaining stable during peak usage periods. This was accomplished by managing the wing-to-wing project implementation with the selected outside vendor and internal IT teams involved. Kronos TM Workforce Central - Key responsibility was to stabilize the application within the Windows 2k/Oracle 9i infrastructure by leveraging a test server for validating patches, and major version updates by the vendor. Once moved to the live production environment, load balancing between 3 application and 1 database server was implemented to better support peak usage times. This allowed the system to always be available for users to accurately record their time and ensured the Human Resource department they were within 99% compliance in handling employee payroll. Managed Offshore Resources during several key Intranet initiatives by assisting in the review and approval of high-level and detail design of business requirements for the enhancements/maintenance of other miscellaneous web applications within the scope of the Consumer Finance IT build team. After the testing phase was complete I assured the hand off from the build to the production run team was a seamless transition that did not interrupt any existing production processes. Initiated the role of a technical support contact providing maintenance and enhancements for three integrated business tracking systems built with classic ASP and MS SQL used to manage the work flow for a Portfolio Services department of 120 associates. Phases of the application were being built by members of the Information Management Leadership Program (IMLP), each with specific requirements to implement within their six month rotation. These rotations left a support gap which I filled to address any system issues as they rose. This resulted in a smoother transition between the IMLP members by allowing them time to focus on and fulfilling their requirements of the program instead of immediately coming into a new rotation addressing issues left by a previous colleague. Implemented a database migration plan from MS SQL Server 6.5 to 2000, which included maintenance schedules and archiving. By the structure of the two versions MS SQL server being completely different, it had to be a two phased approach. Phase one required a migration from 6.5 to 7.0. Phase two was to migrate from 7.0 to 2000. Since support was going to be dropped for MS SQL Server 6.5 the entire project had to be completed within 30 days. This migration allow me to implement a regularly scheduled maintenance plan that reduced end-user downtime from 10 - 20 hours per month to zero The Subject Matter Expert for the Mid-Range Application group in Stamford responsible for conducting a transfer of knowledge from the Atlanta data management personnel back to the Mid-Range team for ongoing support. Due to the elimination of curtain business functions this process had to be successfully completed within 60 days to prevent the possible impact of production systems there after.

 more spend we seek to leverage our existing customer relationships and capture greater share of their business payment expenditures as such we have developed various beyond initiatives where we extend the utility of an existing payment product without degrading the core value proposition of the original product as such a customer can buy more stuff without sacrificing the controls and reporting which attracted the customer to our product to begin with for example
 our fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow nonfuel purchases relevant to their business like allowing a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store so they can finish the paint job
 our toll tag customers can use their invehicle rfid tags to make other on the go purchases like parking fuel and fastfood for our customers these product extensions reduce payment friction saving them time and operational headaches for fleetcor these product extensions can increase our share of wallet with existing customers and can increase our products appeal and applicability to previouslyunserved customer segments eg nontoll urban dwellers we also create new product offerings developed internally or in conjunction with partners to crosssell to our existing customer base

 more spend we seek to leverage our existing customer relationships and capture greater share of their business payment expenditures as such we have developed various beyond initiatives where we extend the utility of an existing payment product without degrading the core value proposition of the original product as such a customer can buy more stuff without sacrificing the controls and reporting which attracted the customer to our product to begin with for example
 our fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow nonfuel purchases relevant to their business like allowing a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store so they can finish the paint job
 our toll tag customers can use their invehicle rfid tags to make other on the go purchases like parking fuel and fastfood for our customers these product extensions reduce payment friction saving them time and operational headaches for fleetcor these product extensions can increase our share of wallet with existing customers and can increase our products appeal and applicability to previouslyunserved customer segments eg nontoll urban dwellers we also create new product offerings developed internally or in conjunction with partners to crosssell to our existing customer base

"         ASP.NET WEB DEVELOPER           Accomplishments      Won Associate of the Month award at CYIENT  Member of the team which won the Team of the Month award for projects such as DEBTS and eRFA        Experience     April 2015   to   Current     Company Name   City  ,   State     ASP.Net Web Developer        Responsibilities:  Migration of IU Print website (print.iu.edu) from ColdFusion to ASP.Net using MVC Framework.  Create a prototype dashboard for IU Print Analytics module using High Charts.         July 2011   to   July 2014     Company Name   City  ,   State     Software Engineer        Responsibilities:  Designed and developed an application to migrate legacy data to ASP.Net application by providing the ability to validate the data to meet the business rules for the new application.  Design the story board using HTML and CSS and design database for applications by analyzing the customer requirements.  Perform code reviews of the modules developed by other team members and participate in pair programming to improve the coding standards of the overall application.  Preparation of build packages and actively participate in integration and deployment phase of the applications. TECHNICALS SKILLS: Programming Languages: C# Web Technologies: SharePoint 2010, ASP.NET 4.0/3.5/2.0, MVC 4 Application Software: Visual Studio 2008/2010/2013, SQL Server Management Studio Databases: SQL Server 2005/2008 R2, MySQL, Oracle Others: HTML, JQuery, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JIRA Source Controls: Team Foundation Sever, GitHub, Visual Source Safe PROJECTS AT WORK: 1) LEDGER: Ledger is developed to manage the task of invoice clearance for different finance benefits trust accounts of Pratt & Whitney. It is also used to track invoices charged back to the department budget or to the various business units. The primary objective of this project was to migrate the existing application which was developed in MS-Access to a web based application by implementing security and adding additional business rules. 2) DEBTS (Daily Equity Based Tax Solution): DEBTS is a tool which is used to calculate employee tax based on certain parameters (medical, social security tax factor). It is developed for UTC USA and deals with all UTC employees' daily equity tax. UBS will place a flat file each day in SFTP with all transactions performed by the employees of UTC. The typical flat file contains employee id, country code, tax details etc. DEBTS tool will connect to SFTP and downloads flat file to perform the validation rules, at last tool will decide the record status (there are 3 statuses as Valid, Exception and Pending). User can login to the system and can review the exception records. And also user can rectify the exceptions to move the exception record to valid records and send the funding files to ADP. 3) Supplier Portal Supplier Portal is designed in SharePoint 2010 to collaborate with their authorized suppliers. Supplier Portal is a merge of seven legacy Pratt and Whitney existing applications into a single portal. The features that are available simplify the way their suppliers can access required business & technical information, as well as how they can provide P&W with valuable delivery information. It is one of the main communication portals and it plays a major role in doing business with Pratt & Whitney. Apart from SharePoint 2010, we used SQL Server 2012 and ASP.Net to develop this application. 4) eRFA (electronic Request For Agreement): RFA is an agreement between two parties (Company and Client) before they start the work. This process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement. The existing process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and approval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to capture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to validate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a web based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an ability to generate various reports required to report of export events. Apart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk data into the database which needs to be validated for the correctness of the data against business rules which determine the type of data that can be uploaded into each column.

Excels at boosting performance and productivity by establishing realistic goals and enforcing deadlines.  Versatile IT professional with 37 years of Enterprise design and engineering methodology.

efforts for a major department modernization project involving 3
accreditation packages each leading to successful Authorization To
Operate decisions.  Responsibilities then increased to include all
departmental accreditation efforts leading to another 3 successful
ATOs.  Now, working on 4 new accreditation including
re-authorization for an existing project.  Succeeded in writing and
implementing vulnerability management for existing accredited
systems.





Success
of the accreditation hinged on coordination with ONI Enterprise in
critical design decisions and to help the program integrate smoothly
into the Enterprise thru many meetings, analyzing the Enterprise
business model to understand the best fit for the program.





The
different projects required careful management of specific STIG
compliance and hardening for the different configurations and
services required for the specific domain to be integrated.   Analyzed complex computer systems to assess vulnerability and risk.    Supervised  5  external computer consultants and vendors.    Managed application patches, data backup, security changes and network configuration.           Company Name    City  ,   State    Systems Engineer   02/2006   to   02/2011        I was Hired
to initiate processing strategies in fulfilling department analyst requirements.  Requirements were fulfilled thru i dentifying product problems and strengths and collected data on customer experience  and review of Enterprise compliance to transition to new
technology for supporting new processing needs thru proper processing
power.  The next challenge  came as storage requirements for better performance and more
controlled uses.  After careful study of local infrastructure design, a local storage with off the shelf solutions was
adopted to grow local storage to over 200TB.  In using this solution,
the department saved just over a million dollars in purchasing and
maintenance costs compared to the alternative. Next came requirements to improve processing of future big data formats fulfilled in a Red Hat Linux high compute cluster I designed, purchased and
accredited for operation in the Enterprise.  Improvement on big data analytical processing reduced time from
30 hours to 30 minutes as well as allow for more robust data thru
higher selections of sensors, frequencies and range than allowed thru
the traditional process.         Company Name    City  ,   State    Senior Systems Analyst   02/1999   to   02/2006        I was hired to improve corporate and
client communications and processing requirements which resulted in
the design, build and deployment of 3 Enterprise network solutions.  One
solution resulted in expanding capabilities to supporting Washington
Navy Yard, Norfolk Virginia and Hawaii support facilities. 






Fulfilled
requirements for detecting crucial network software/hardware
weaknesses and developing preventive strategies and solutions for
avoiding interruptions and increasing system security thru

efforts for a major department modernization project involving 3
accreditation packages each leading to successful Authorization To
Operate decisions.  Responsibilities then increased to include all
departmental accreditation efforts leading to another 3 successful
ATOs.  Now, working on 4 new accreditation including
re-authorization for an existing project.  Succeeded in writing and
implementing vulnerability management for existing accredited
systems.





Success
of the accreditation hinged on coordination with ONI Enterprise in
critical design decisions and to help the program integrate smoothly
into the Enterprise thru many meetings, analyzing the Enterprise
business model to understand the best fit for the program.





The
different projects required careful management of specific STIG
compliance and hardening for the different configurations and
services required for the specific domain to be integrated.   Analyzed complex computer systems to assess vulnerability and risk.    Supervised  5  external computer consultants and vendors.    Managed application patches, data backup, security changes and network configuration.           Company Name    City  ,   State    Systems Engineer   02/2006   to   02/2011        I was Hired
to initiate processing strategies in fulfilling department analyst requirements.  Requirements were fulfilled thru i dentifying product problems and strengths and collected data on customer experience  and review of Enterprise compliance to transition to new
technology for supporting new processing needs thru proper processing
power.  The next challenge  came as storage requirements for better performance and more
controlled uses.  After careful study of local infrastructure design, a local storage with off the shelf solutions was
adopted to grow local storage to over 200TB.  In using this solution,
the department saved just over a million dollars in purchasing and
maintenance costs compared to the alternative. Next came requirements to improve processing of future big data formats fulfilled in a Red Hat Linux high compute cluster I designed, purchased and
accredited for operation in the Enterprise.  Improvement on big data analytical processing reduced time from
30 hours to 30 minutes as well as allow for more robust data thru
higher selections of sensors, frequencies and range than allowed thru
the traditional process.         Company Name    City  ,   State    Senior Systems Analyst   02/1999   to   02/2006        I was hired to improve corporate and
client communications and processing requirements which resulted in
the design, build and deployment of 3 Enterprise network solutions.  One
solution resulted in expanding capabilities to supporting Washington
Navy Yard, Norfolk Virginia and Hawaii support facilities. 






Fulfilled
requirements for detecting crucial network software/hardware
weaknesses and developing preventive strategies and solutions for
avoiding interruptions and increasing system security thru
documenting system layouts, wiring diagrams and addressing schema to
understand layouts and make informed solutions to upper management.
